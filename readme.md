##Code Divergences
There may be a few spots where my code editor's auto-format (vscode) caused some strange formatting, particularly in blade files. Did my best to fix them manually before pushing.

##Notes for instructor
Form validation was not very useful for the 'player search' field since it is designed to accept any search. So I made a useless 'Say Hello!' form that you can activate from the footer just for the sake of praciting a 'POST' request with form validation.
