## Code Divergences
There may be a few spots where my code editor's auto-format (vscode) caused some strange formatting, particularly in the blade files. Did my best to fix them manually before final push.

## Notes for instructor
Form validation was not necessary for the 'player search' field since it is designed to accept any search. So I made a dummy 'Get updates' form (activated with link in the top right corner) for the sake of praciting a 'POST' request with form validation and meeting the project requirements.
